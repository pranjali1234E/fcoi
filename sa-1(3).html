    <p>Hyderabad, the most populous and biggest city in the Telangana state, is the largest urban area in entire south-central India. Between 1956 and 2014, when Telangana, a state that is an extension of Andhra Pradesh, was created, Hyderabad served as the state of Andhra Pradesh's capital. The city is known for its famous foods like Hyderbadi biryani and Hyderabadi haleem.

        The city's final name, Hyderabad, followed its former iteration as Bhagyanagar, meaning "rich city" Since Andhra Pradesh opened the way for the split, Telangana has become a preferred destination for IT businesses. It was specifically intended to grow Hyderabad concurrently with the state. As a result of the city's development, which started more than 20 years ago, the old Hyderabad has been "Terraformed" and is currently being rapidly transformed into a smart metropolis.</p>
